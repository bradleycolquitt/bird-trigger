* TODO Buffer video feed
** Sample every 500 ms
** If mean of buffer > thresh: trigger
* TODO Set up config file read
* TODO More triggerevent options
** Save video and pad if trigger


## Classes:

TriggerGui
TargetGui

MainFeed
    contains video feed and dictionary of Targets
    image is subprocessed to each target and processed independently
    contains Logger to record threshold events and events Triggered


Target
   contains roi and functions to analyze pixels within roi
   specification of TriggerEvent
   function to run 2 subprocesses
      1. real-time compute of ROI stats and updates buffer
          if pixel means over threshold
             add value to buffer
             if time_increment: 
                 check if buffer mean over thresh
      2. subprocess that periodically checks if buffer over some threshold

TriggerEvent
       contains multiple functions for possible output events 

## Protocol 
   Initialize main feed
   Take background image
   Define target regions on image
   Load config file containing
        buffer size
        time period
        number events per time period
             or 
        number events before refractory
        datetime active 
        
   Specify TriggerEvent
